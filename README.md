<p><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong><br>
This project portrays my vision of a working farm that offers a bed & breakfast and fun activities in addition to fresh produce available at its market.
</p>

<p><strong>CHALLENGES:</strong><br>
I wrote extensive JavaScript code to properly display "open" or "closed" according to the hours of operation. The market order form required the use of $watchGroup in order to ensure that values are updated immediately upon any changes. ngRoute was implemented to minimize the amount of data requests sent to the server.

<p><strong>FRAMEWORKS USED:</strong><br>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap</p>
